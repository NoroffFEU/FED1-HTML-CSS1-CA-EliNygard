## Description
This is a web page for the fictional client Square Eyes.

The goal was to put into practice everything Iâ€™ve learned about HTML and CSS over this second course at Front-end Developent Studies at Noroff, by bringing my design from the Design CA alive.

##### Look for the film "Who Goes There?"

#### Info about the client and instructions:
Square Eyes is a video streaming website where you can purchase high-quality videos directly from the people who make them. The users of this website want to purchase videos right away, which will allow them to watch it online.

The website should emphasise that you can easily discover great collections or browse through different categories to find films.

- Slogan: Connecting Film-Lovers
- Target audiences: Aged 25 to 40 and are interested in cinema. They enjoy watching interesting and high-quality films.
