## Description
This is a web page for the fictional client Square Eyes.

The goal was to put into practice everything I’ve learned about HTML and CSS over this second course at Front-end Developent Studies at Noroff, by bringing my design from the Design CA alive.

##### Look for the film "Who Goes There?"

#### Info about the client and instructions:
