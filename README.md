## Description
This is a blog page for the fictional client Tórshavn Science Museum. 

The aim was to use the new knowledgde of project planning, web design and development I have learned over the first semester of the Front-end Development studies at Noroff.

To do that, I was "hired" to design and build a modern, accessible and responsive web presence for the client. Images and text was provided. 

#### Info about the client and instructions:
The museum is opening soon. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children.

The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; while aiming at a younger audience it should not patronise them with overtly childish themes. The core purpose of the site is to excite and entice people to visit the museum.

## Built With
I have used Figma to design the web page, and built it with HTML and CSS.
